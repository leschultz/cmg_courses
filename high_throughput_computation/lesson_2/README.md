# Lesson 2: Use a template and modify slightly to generate n number of jobs

Create jobs with:

```
bash create_jobs.sh
```

Submit jobs with:

```
bash submit_jobs.sh
```

Remember that you can change the type of computation performed by modifying the job in template. You can then change variables in a script by replacing them with sed and submitting each as individual jobs across many computers.
